# [Shuffle](shuffle_basics.md)

[Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_shuffle) is a rave dance that
developed in the 1980s. Typically performed to electronic music, the dance
originated in the Melbourne rave scene, and was popular in the 1980s and
1990s. The dance moves involve a fast heel-and-toe movement or T-step,
combined with a variation of the running man coupled with a matching arm
action. It's an improvised dance and involves "shuffling your feet
inwards, then outwards, while thrusting your arms up and down, or side to side,
in time with the beat".

It seems to be a minority underground dance without official competitions or schools. Given the music, it's origins and the energy it requires, most of the
videos are uploaded by young people that reproduce the nasty gender roles that
the society embeds in us. So expect to see over sexualized girls and over
testosteroned guys, which is sad.

### Melbourne Shuffle

It's the original shuffle, which was the one that caught my eye several years
back with Francis' video:

It's "simple and straightforward", the base is the running man, with a few kicks
and spins sprinkled in from time to time, so there is not much room for variety.
It has a low skill floor and a moderate skill ceiling.

Usually the dancers wear trousers with a wide end that makes a nice flying visual
effect and a hoodie. The percent of read women Melbourne shuffle videos is low.

Here is a list of other Melbourne shuffle videos:

The [malasian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RXBtYEX5ds) and [russian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8XtaP0ZHVg)
styles are, to my untrained eye, similar to the Melbourne, although they've got different T-step.

Although in the source post they say that these styles are usually danced
between 150 and 200 bpms, I've found that the videos range from 130 to 160 bpms
with an average of 150 bpms.

### Cutting shapes

It's the most popular right now (at least for the number of videos I've found).
The base steps are the Charleston or the heel variants of the running man, which
looks less like running. The basic step is used less than in the other styles,
filling most of the moves with heel-toe movements, criss-crossings, and spins,
so there is little "shuffling" in cutting shapes. It has a low skill floor, but
an absurdly high skill ceiling. There is a lot of room for variety and you can
even mix it up by adding other dance styles to it, as it's very flexible.

Usually the dancers wear street clothes and some use shoes with led lights.
The percent of read women Cutting shapes shuffle videos is even with read males.
