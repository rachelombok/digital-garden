Shuffle steps are usually split each tempo into two phases, songs usually follow
a 4/4 structure. To differentiate the steps between tempos I'm going to use the
tempo number they come from followed by an `-and` so the structure will be:
`8-and`, `1`, `1-and`, `2`... Where the `1` is the phrase starter.

Most of the steps don't have names so I've put one that felt it fits.

To specify the relative position of body parts, I'm using an imaginary clock, so
12 means upfront, 3 our right, 6 our back and 9 our left.

The steps below can be danced with "slow" or quick tempos. It's best to learn
with the slow ones as they build the muscle memory to be able to skip parts of
it as you move to higher tempos.

# Dance routine

After several iterations I've come to this routine:

* Start dancing a bit to low tempo songs, I've got a playlist with increasing
    tempo songs, the aim is to start warming up and remember what I've learnt
    the last time.
* Once you're warmed up dance some songs to your current tempo level.
* Then put some songs a little above your tempo level and try to speed up your
    [running man](#quick-tempo-running-man) and [T-Step](#quick-tempo-t-step).
* Improve this notes with the new discoveries.
* Analyze a video to extract some steps.
* Add one or two songs to the shuffle playlist. Prepend the song name [with the
    bpms](http://www.beatsperminuteonline.com/) (it's better to measure them
    manually as automatic software tends to fail badly).

# Running man

The running man is the basic step of Melbourne shuffle, so make sure to master
it.

* *8-and*: Both legs straight under our body, right leg lifted up
    with knee up front. Weight lies on the left foot.
* *1*: Right foot kicks forward, left foot slides backward, in a way that each travel the
    same distance. Weight is evenly shared between the feet.
* *1-and*: Right foot slides backwards, right foot goes up, knee to the front.
    Weight lies on the right foot.
* *2*: Mirrors *1*.
* *2-and*: Mirrors *1-and* and it's equal to *8-and*.

Once you feel comfortable with it, start going around the room doing running
mans, so you get a grasp of doing it without being stationary.

The foot going forward can land in the floor flat, heel first or toes first.

## Quick tempo Running man

As the tempo speeds up, even if it seems there is no time to stop in the *1-and*
or *2-and* they do manage to do so. To reach there, I'd put a song a little bit quicker than
you are comfortable and:

* Get familiarity with the movement of the foot in the ground: Start with your
    basic running man stance left foot in front. When the *1* comes, try to
    reach the *1-and* focusing to lift your right knee and stomp in the *2*.
    Rest a pair of beats and then try the other foot. Keep on doing it till you
    are comfortable doing this movement.
* Then try to do 2 complete running mans.
* Then dance :).

For me the most difficult part is to bring back the non dominant leg backwards,
to get used to the movement I slided backwards with that leg several times, then
do three running mans starting with that leg, rest, and then do another three
starting with the other one.

# T-Step

The T-Step is other basic step of Melbourne shuffle, used to do lateral
movement.

## Learning the T-Step

The following instructions are a nice way to get the grasp of the movement, but
we'll change them slightly to be able to link it with the other moves.

![ ](shuffle_t_shape_kicks.gif)

* *8-and*: Both legs straight under our body, right leg lifted up
    with knee up front. Weight lies on the left foot, which looks at 1.5
    although the rest of you look at 12.
* *1*: Right foot kicks sideways towards 3, try to leave the foot at 90 degrees
    with your leg and that it doesn't wobble, so it's a clean kick. The weight
    is on the left leg's toes and it pivotes over them till it points to 10.5.
    Waist ends up turned.
* *1-and*: Right foot is retrieved till the left leg's knee, keeping the base
    parallel to the ground. Weight is on the left leg's heel and pivotes over
    it to reach the 1.5 position. Waist is straight now.
* *2*: Equal to *1*.
* *2-and*: Equal to *1-and*.
* *3*: Right foot goes front, left foot goes back to the running man stance.

To move to the other side is the mirror.

Keep the leg that holds you a bit bent so you don't harm your knee when
twisting.

![ ](shuffle_t_shape_kicks_tutorial.gif)

The usual basic pattern of Melbourne shuffle is doing some running mans pointing
at 10.5, then doing a side step (like the T-step) to the right, then another
running man pointing to 1.5, finishing with another side step to the left.

To join the T-Step with the running man, when you are in the *1-and* make it the
*8-and* of the T-Step.

### Francis T-Step

![ ](francis_t_step.gif)

I've seen that Francis when finishes his T-Step with the other leg. So instead
of moving the right leg in front and slide back the left (if we are going to the
right), he:

* *1-and*: Equal to normal T-Step.
* *2*: When you put your right foot down, shift your weight till it's evenly
    spread between feet.
* *2-and*: Switch your weight to the right foot, lift the left while you keep on
    shifting your body weight to your 3.
* *3*: Left foot touches ground at your 1.5, slide the right back to the running
    man stance.

What I like of this variation is that you conserve the energy, it makes total
sense. What it doesn't is that he is dancing with sandals `(¬º-°)¬`.

Try to move from side to side with 2 T-Steps in between using this variation.

## Quick tempo T-Step

To improve the speed of your T-Steps, I'd put a song a little bit quicker than
you are comfortable and:

* Get familiarity with the movement of the foot in the ground:

    * Start with your right knee up in position *8-and* of the T-Step.
    * First focus only to move the feet that you've got in the floor, so when
        the *1* comes, start pivoting the foot a pair of tempos.
    * Put your right foot down and lift the left knee.
    * Wait 3 or 4 tempos and when the *1* comes, start going to the other side.

* Once you are comfortable with the movement, repeat the same exercise but doing
the kicks.
* Then instead of finishing with both feet under your body, finish in a running
    man stance.
* Then instead of starting with your knee up, start from the running man stance.
