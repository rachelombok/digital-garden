[Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) are an application
architecture style where independent, self-contained programs with a single
purpose each can communicate with each other over a network. Typically, these
microservices are able to be deployed independently because they have strong
separation of responsibilities via a well-defined specification with significant
backwards compatibility to avoid sudden dependency breakage.

## Books

* [Hand-On Docker for Microservices with Python by Jaime
    Buelta](https://www.packtpub.com/eu/web-development/hands-on-docker-for-microservices-with-python):
    Does a good job defining the whole process of building a microservices
    python application, from the microservice concept to the definition of the
    CI, integration testing, deployment in Kubernetes, definition of logging and
    metrics. But it doesn't help much with the project layout definition or if
    you want to build your application while following it.
* [Hands-On RESTful Python Web Services by Gaston
    C.Hillar](https://www.packtpub.com/eu/application-development/hands-restful-python-web-services-second-edition):
    I didn't like it at all.
