[Domain-driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)(DDD)
is the concept that the structure and language of your code (class names, class
methods, class variables) should match the business domain.

Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:

* Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic.
* Basing complex designs on a model of the domain.
* Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to
    iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain
    problems.

It aims to fix these common pitfalls:

* When asked to design a new system, most developers will start to build
a database schema, with the object model treated as an afterthought. Instead,
*behaviour should come first and drive our storage requirements*.

* Business logic comes spread throughout the layers of our application, making
  it hard to identify, understand and change.

* The feared [big ball of
mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud).

They are avoided through:

* *Encapsulation an abstraction*: understanding behavior encapsulation as
    identifying a task that needs to be done in our code and giving that task to
    an abstraction, a well defined object or function.

    Encapsulating behavior with abstractions is a powerful decoupling tool by
    hiding details and protecting the consistency of our data, making code more
    expressive, more testable and easier to maintain.

* *Layering*: When one function, module or object uses another, we say that one
    *depends on* the other creating a dependency graph. In the big ball of mud
    the dependencies are out of control, so changing one node becomes difficult
    because it has the potential to affect many other parts of the system.

    Layered architectures are one way of tackling this problem by dividing our
    code into discrete categories or roles, and introducing rules about which
    categories of code can call each other.

    By following the [Dependency Inversion
    Principle](solid.md#dependency-inversion) (the *D* in [SOLID](solid.md)), we
    must ensure that our business code doesn't depend on technical details,
    instead, both should use abstractions. We don't want high-level modules
    ,which respond to business needs, to be slowed down because they are closely
    coupled to low-level infrastructure details, which are often harder to
    change. Similarly, it is important to *be able* to change the infrastructure
    details when we need to without needing to make changes to the business
    layer.

# [Domain modeling](https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_01_domain_model.html)

Keeping in mind that *Domain* is the problem you are trying to solve, and
*Model* A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and
can be used to solve problems related to that domain. The domain model is the
mental map that business owners have of their businesses.

It's set in a *context* and it's defined through *ubiquitous language*.
A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to
connect all the activities of the team with the software.

To successfully build a domain model we need to:

* [*Explore the domain language*](https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_01_domain_model.html):
    Have an initial conversation with the business expert and agree on
    a glossary and some rules for the first minimal version of the domain model.
    Wherever possible, ask for concrete examples to illustrate each rule.
* [*Testing the domain models*](https://www.cosmicpython.com/book/chapter_01_domain_model.html#_unit_testing_domain_models):
    Translate each of the rules gathered in the exploration phase into tests.
    Keeping in mind:

    * The name of our tests should describe the behaviour that we want to see
        from the system.

    * The test level in the testing pyramid should be chosen following the [high and
    low gear metaphor](tdd.md#tdd-in-high-gear-and-low-gear).

* *Code the [domain modeling object](#domain-modeling-objects)*:
    Choose the objects that match the behavior you are testing keeping in mind:

    * The names of the classes, methods, functions and variables should be taken
        from the business jargon.

## Domain modeling objects

* *Value object*: Any domain object that is uniquely identified by the data it
    holds, so it has no conceptual identity. They should be treated as
    immutable. We can still have complex behaviour in value objects.
    In fact, it's common to support operations, for example, mathematical
    operators.

    [dataclasses](data_classes.md) are great for value objects because:

    * They follow the *value equality* property (two objects with the same attributes are treated as
    equal).
    * Can be defined as immutable with the `frozen=True` decorator argument.
    * They define the `__hash__` magic method based on the attribute values.
        `__hash__` is used by Python to control the behaviour of objects when
        you add them to sets or use them as dict keys.

    ```python
    @dataclass(frozen=True)
    class Name:
        first_name: str
        surname: str

    assert Name('Harry', 'Percival') == Name('Harry', 'Percival')
    assert Name('Harry', 'Percival') != Name('Bob', 'Gregory')
    ```

* *Entity*: An object that is not defined by it's attributes, but rather by
    a thread of continuity and it's identity. Unlike values, they have *identity
    equality*. We can change their values, and they are still recognizably the
    same thing.

    ```python
    class Person:

        def __init__(self, name: Name):
            self.name = name

    def test_barry_is_harry():
        harry = Person(Name("Harry", "Percival"))
        barry = harry

        barry.name = Namew("Barry", "Percival")

        assert harry is barry and barry is harry
    ```

    We usually make this explicit in code by implementing equality operators on
    entities:

    ```python
    class Person:
        ...

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, Person):
            return False
        return other.identifier == self.identifier

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash(self.identifier)
    ```

    Python's `__eq__` magic method defines the behavior of the class for the
    `==` operator.

    For entities, the simplest option is to say that the hash is `None`, meaning
    that the object is not hashable so it can't be used as dictionary keys. If
    for some reason you need that, the hash should be based on the attribute
    that identifies the object over the time. You should also try to somehow
    make that attribute read-only. Beware, editing `__hash__` without modifying
    `__eq__` is [tricky
    business](https://hynek.me/articles/hashes-and-equality/).

* *Service*: Functions that hold operations that don't conceptually belong to any object. We
    take advantage of the fact that Python is a multiparadigm language.

* *Exceptions*: Hold constrains imposed over the objects by the business.

## Domain modeling patterns

To build a rich robust object model that is decoupled from technical concerns we
need to build persistence-ignorant code that uses stable APIs around our domain
 so we can refactor aggressively.

This is achieved through these design patterns:

 * [*Repository pattern*](repository_pattern.md): An abstraction over the idea of persistent storage.
 * [*Service Layer pattern*](service_layer_pattern.md): Clearly define where our
     use case begins and ends.
 * *Unit of work pattern*: Provides atomic operations.
 * *Aggregate pattern*: Enforces integrity of our data.

# Unconnected thoughts

## Domain model refactor

Refactoring an existing project into the domain driven design architecture is
not a nice task, These are the steps I've followed:

* If the domain models are coupled with the ORM, [build a basic
repository](repository_pattern.md) that makes the ORM dependent on the model.
For the first version, ignore the relations between the
models, just implement the `.add` and `.get` methods to persist and read the
models from the persistent storage solution.
* Create a `FakeRepository` with similar functionality to start building the
    Service Layer.
* Inspect the entrypoints of your program and for each orchestration action
    create a service (always tests first).

## Building blocks

* *Aggregate*: A collection of objects that are bound together by a root entity,
    otherwise known as an aggregate root. The aggregate root guarantees the
    consistency of changes being made within the aggregate by forbidding
    external objects from holding references to it's members.
* *Domain Event*: A domain object that defines an event.
* *Repository*: Methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to
    a specialized Repository object such that alternative storage
    implementations may be easily interchanged.
* *Factory*: Methods for creating domain objects should delegate to
    a specialized Factory object such that alternative implementations may be
    easily interchanged.

# Injection of fakes in edge to edge tests

If you are developing your program with this design pattern, you'll have fake
versions of your adapters. When testing the edge to edge tests, you're going to
use the fakes when there is no easy way to do a correct end to end test (if for
example you need to bring up a service that is complex to configure).

I've been banging my head against the keyboard until I've figured how to do it
for [click command line tests](click.md#injecting-fake-dependencies).
