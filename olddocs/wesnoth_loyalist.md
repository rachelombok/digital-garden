The [Loyalist](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Loyalists) are a faction of
[Humans](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Humans) who are loyal to the throne of
Wesnoth.

The race of men is an extremely diverse one. Although they originally came from
the Old Continent, men have spread all over the world and split into many
different cultures and races. Although they are not imbued with magic like other
creatures, humans can learn to wield it and able to learn more types than most
others. They have no extra special abilities or aptitudes except their
versatility and drive. While often at odds with all races, they can occasionally
form alliances with the less aggressive races such as elves and dwarves. The
less scrupulous among them do not shrink back from hiring orcish mercenaries,
either. They have no natural enemies, although the majority of men, like most
people of all races, have an instinctive dislike of the undead. Men are shorter
than the elves, but taller still than dwarves. Their skin color can vary, from
almost white to dark brown. Humans are a versatile race who specialize in many
different areas.

Similarly, the Loyalist faction is a very versatile melee oriented faction with
important ranged support from *bowmen* and *mages*.

# [How to play loyalists](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists)

Loyalists are considered to be the most versatile faction in the game. They have
most available unit types to recruit (8), more than any other faction.

Loyalists are mostly melee oriented faction, with only two ranged unit types,
the *mage* and the *bowman*, but their ranged units play a significant role in the
loyalists strategy and have to be used effectively. About the melee troops the
loyalist player gets to choose among:

* *Heavy Infantrymen*: Few strikes, high damage per strike, slow, higher
    hit-points, good resistances, low defenses, deals impact damage which is good
    against undead.

* *Spearmen*: Average strikes, average damage per strike, average movement,
    medium hit-points, normal resistances, average defenses, deals pierce damage
    which is good against drakes, has a weak ranged attack.

* *Fencer*: High number of strikes, low damage per strike, quick, low hit-points,
    bad resistances, good defenses, deals blade damage which is good against
    elusive foots or wose, deals less total damage than the other two, is
    a skirmisher.

The loyalists unit price ranges from the cheap *spearmen* and *mermen* (14 gold) to
the expensive *horsemen* (23 gold).

Loyalist units generally have good hit-points and they deal good damage, even the
cheap *spearmen* and *bowmen*. Even their scouts have high hit-points and better
melee attack compared to most of the scouts of the other factions. But on the
other hand, the loyalist scouts have lower defenses than most of the other
scouts and they do not have a ranged attack.

The loyalists have some units with good resistances, like *Heavy Infantry* or
*Cavalryman*, which can be very good for defending if you notice that your
opponent doesn't have the proper units to counter them. Other units, like the
*bowman*, who is more vulnerable than the previous two, but is also good for
defense because it has better defense, is cheaper and it deals solid damage back
in both melee and range. Similar goes for the *spearman*.

**When attacking**, Loyalists have units which can be pretty devastating, like the
*horseman* for attacking enemy *mages* and other ranged units, *mages* against the
entrenched melee units, *fencers* for killing enemy injured and valuable units
trying to heal behind their lines. But the mentioned units are also very
vulnerable and they can die very easily if not properly supported.

The loyalists as a faction generally have average *defenses* (they do not get
70% defense anywhere, with the exception of the fencer, which is a special case)
and they are not a terrain dependent faction (like the Elves or Knalgans are).
Therefore, even if it good to put *spearmen* and *bowmen* on mountains, villages
and castles where they get 60% defense, you should also take the faction you are
facing into account when deciding where to place your units. For example, if you
are fighting Knalgans, you should try not to move your units next to hills and
mountains and/or take the hills and mountains with your units and leave the
forest to the dwarves.

All the loyalist units are lawful, which obviously leads to the conclusion that
the loyalists should be more aggressive and attack at day (or even start at
dawn, because your opponent in most of the cases will be reluctant to attack too
aggressively and leave units on bad ground when the morning arrives) while at
night the loyalists should at least play conservatively, or in some cases even
run away. Of course, that is also dependent upon the faction of your opponent.

**The greatest weakness** of the loyalists is their limited mobility. The
loyalists' units have normal movement, some of their units like the
*horseman*, *cavalryman*, *merman fighter* and the *fencer* are pretty quick
when they are in their favorable environment, but all their units get slowed
over rough terrain a lot compared to the other factions' units . Half of the
loyalists units can not even move on/over mountains, and their scouts get
significantly slowed in forest, for example. This lack of mobility will often
give your opponent an opportunity to outmaneuver you in the game.To prevent
that, sometimes it is good to attack hard on a certain point and defend only
with minimal amount of units elsewhere, rather than uniformly spreading your
units around the front.

When you don't know which faction you are facing, it is good to get a mixture
of units. On most of the default 1v1 maps, this initial recruitment list would
be good : *spearman*, *bowman*, *fencer*, *mage*, *merman fighter*,
*cavalryman*. As always, you should carefully consider about the exact placement
of each individual unit from the initial recruits on the castle to come up with
the most optimal combination that will allow you the quickest village grabbing
in the first turns of the game.

## [Loyalists vs. Undead](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists#Loyalists_vs._Undead)

When fighting undead, your recruiting pattern will depend on whether your
opponent spams **skeleton archers** or *dark adepts* for ranged attacks. If you see
lots of skeletons, you'll have to focus heavily on *heavy infrantrymen* and
*mages*. If you see lots of *dark adepts*, you'll want some *cavalry*,
*horsemen* and maybe some *spearmen*.

* *Bowman*: (**D-**) Almost entirely useless. You might use them to poke at
    *walking corpses*, *ghouls*, *vampire bats* and *ghosts*, but *mages* are
    much better at all of these things. I would only buy a *bowman* to counter
    a large zombie horde.

* *Cavalryman*: (**B+**) You'll want some *cavalry* for scouting and dealing
    initial damage to *dark adepts* so that a *horseman* can finish them. They
    are also decent at fighting Skeletons in the daytime, because *cavalry* are
    blade-resistant. However, the cheap *skeleton archers* will really ruin
    *cavalry* quickly at night, so if there are any *skeleton archers* on the other
    side you won't be able to use *cavalry* to hold territory. If your opponent
    over-recruits *dark adepts*, however, you can use cold-resistant *cavalry* to hold
    territory against them. They are also decent for holding territory against
    *ghouls* because they can run away and heal (unlike your *heavy infantrymen*).

* *Fencer*: (**C-**) Fencers are a bad recruit in this match up because they are
    vulnerable to the blade and pierce damage of skeletons and cannot damage
    them much in return. They also are incapable of holding territory against
    *dark adepts*, who cut right through the high defense of *fencers*. However,
    you may want to have a *fencer* or two around for trapping *dark adepts* or
    getting in that last hit. With luck, they may also be able to frustrate
    non-magical attacks from skeletons and the like.

* *Heavy Infantryman*: (**B+**) You need *heavy infantry* to hold territory
    against *skeletons* and *skeleton archers*, and they will be your unit of
    choice for dealing melee damage, especially to the cheap *skeleton archers*.
    Any *heavy infantrymen* in the daytime can kill a full health skeleton
    archer in two hits, while a strong *heavy infantrymen* in the daytime can
    kill a full health skeleton in two hits, dealing 18 damage per strike (even
    a *mage* in daytime cannot kill a skeleton in one round, unless supported by
    a *lieutenant*). A fearless *heavy infantryman* may be dangerous even at
    night. If you don't have enough *heavy infantryman* to go around, you can
    get your initial hits in on a *skeleton archer* with them and finish him
    with a *mage*. Just keep *heavy infantrymen* away from *dark adepts*, and
    only let *ghouls* hit *heavy infantrymen* if they are on a village (or has
    a *white mage* or other healer next to him), since they can't easily run
    away to heal. Also beware *walking corpses*, which deal a surprising amount
    of damage at all times of day since *heavy infantrymen* can't dodge and
    impact damage goes around their resistances, and the ranged cold attack of
    *ghosts*. The biggest problem with *heavy infantrymen* is they are slow,
    which means they're hard to retreat at night and hard to advance in day.
    Without shielding units they'll get trapped and killed, and if you have to
    shield a unit maybe it should be a *mage* instead.

* *Horseman*: (**B**) - Because they deal pierce damage, *horsemen* may not be
    very useful when faced with *skeletons*. However, if your opponent
    over-recruits *dark adepts*, *horsemen* can be extremely useful, as *dark
    adepts* deal no return damage to the normally risky charge attack.
    *horsemen* can even be used to finish *skeleton archers*, their nemesis, in
    the daytime. However, if your opponent recruits enough *skeleton archers*
    you will have a hard time shielding your *horsemen* from their devastating
    pierce attacks, and *skeleton archers* are dirt cheap. *horsemen* can also
    one-shot *bats* and *zombies*, which can be useful if you need to clear out
    a lot of level 0 units quickly. I would want to have at least one *horseman*
    around to keep my opponent from getting too bold with *dark adepts*, if not
    more. Your opponent will be forced to recruit *dark adepts* if you have
    *heavy infantrymen* in the field.

* *Mage*: (**A+**) *mages* are an absolute necessity against Undead. If you do
    not have *mages* it will be almost impossible for you to kill *ghosts*, but
    with *mages* it's a piece of cake. *mages* are the best unit for killing
    almost everything Undead can throw at you, and can even be used to finish
    *dark adepts* in the daytime. Your main problem is that *dark adepts* are
    cheaper and deal almost as much damage, so your opponent can spam *dark
    adepts* while you cannot afford to spam *mages*. You will also have the
    difficult task of shielding fragile, expensive *mages* against lots of cheap
    Undead units. Your opponent will use *skeletons* and *ghouls* to attack your
    *mages* when he can, but *bats*, *zombies* or just about any other unit will
    do for killing your *mages* in a pinch. Shield your *mages* well, surround
    them with damage soakers and if you can deliver them safely to their targets
    you'll be able to clear out the Undead quickly.

* *Merman Fighter*: (**C-**) Mermen make a decent navy against Undead, since
    *bats* and *ghosts* will have a hard time killing them with their high
    defense. Even *dark adepts* will find Mermen annoying because of their 20%
    cold resistance. However, Mermen will have a hard time hurting anything the
    Undead have with their lame pierce weapon. Generally Mermen are only good
    for holding water hexes and scouting, but don't underestimate how useful
    that can be. Some well-placed Mermen on a water map can prevent *bats* from
    sneaking behind your lines and capturing villages or killing injured units.
    Even on mostly land maps, a Merman in a river can help hold a defensive
    line, or a quick Merman can use a river to slip behind the enemy to trap
    *dark adepts* or other units that are trying to escape at daytime.

* *Spearman*: (**C-**) *Spearmen* are mostly useful as cheap units for holding
    villages and occupying space when faced with *dark adepts* or *skeleton
    archers*. (You'll want to avoid letting *dark adepts* hit your *heavy
    infantrymen* because of their vulnerability to cold.) However, you don't
    really want *spearmen* to take hits from *dark adepts*, it would be better
    to let the cold-resistant *cavalry* absorb the damage. The only units
    *spearmen* are good for attacking are *dark adepts* and *walking corpses*.
    *spearmen* are completely useless against *skeletons* unless you level one
    into a *swordsman*, and even then they're pretty mediocre. However, if there
    are lots of *skeleton archers* you won't be able to use much *cavalry* or
    *horsemen*, so a *spearman* or two may be necessary as defenders and damage
    soakers even if they are lousy at dealing damage to Undead.

## [Loyalists vs. Rebels](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists#Loyalists_vs._Rebels)

[Rebels](wesnoth_rebels.md) are a very versatile faction like the Loyalists. So you need to counter
their versatility with yours. Their weakest trait is low hit-points. That is
compensated somewhat by relatively higher defenses and mobility, so you'll need
a combination of hard-hitters and speed. *mages* are also nice for their magical
attacks. Anyways, the key for a Loyalist general is to effectively use his
hard-hitting units and kill as many units as he can at day. And at night, to
defend well as elves ignore the time of day.

The smartest thing you can do upon discovering that your opponent is playing
Rebels, in multiplayer, is to assume that your opponent has *woses* and recruit
accordingly. *woses* are a necessary counter to Loyalists' daytime attacks and
as soon as your opponent realizes that you are Loyalists he will almost
certainly recruit *woses*. Remember that just because you don't see any *woses*
doesn't mean there aren't a couple hiding in the forest! To fight *woses* you
will need *cavalry* as meat shields, *mages* to deal damage, and maybe *fencers*
to get the last hit in. Sadly, *cavalry* are very vulnerable to *elvish archers*,
so you'll need to make sure that the archers die, which can be difficult if they
are in forest. Get *horsemen* which can one-shot archers (despite their high
dodge) and keep up with your *cavalry*. If one *horseman* misses, follow up with
another one, it's a lucky archer that can dodge 4/4 one-shot attempts. *heavy
infantrymen* are also great against everything but *woses* and *mages*, and will
reduce the effectiveness of archer spam. *spearmen* are useless against *woses*,
recruit them sparingly and keep them away from unscouted forest.

An alternative way of playing this match up is to maximize the mobility offered
by the Loyalists' fastest units, namely the two horse units. By using them to
outrun the Rebel units you can achieve some devastating rushes. Some matches
require use of both styles of playing. Again, their versatility must be
countered with yours.

* *Bowman*: (**C-**) Rebels in general are effective in both melee and ranged
    attacks, so recruiting a ranged unit is less beneficial than most factions
    because most of the Rebels' units can retaliate against you. They can be
    useful for taking out an Scout or two, but otherwise, this is not really
    a smart buy.

* *Cavalryman*: (**B+**) A good scout and an effective counter to *woses*. Watch
    out for archers, though, they can really tear horses to shreds. And as
    always, they are effective against ranged oriented units like the *mage*.

    (**A**) If you're going for some faster action, *cavalrymen* are vital in
    the attack. They do great damage during the day, and combined with their
    dangerous mobility, they can be a fearsome unit indeed. Just be careful of
    archers ZoCing you and tearing the unit to shreds.

* *Fencer*: (**B+**) The *fencer* shares the 70% defense in the forest like most
    of the elves, but it has negative resistances. Theoretically, they should be
    effective against *woses*, but more often than not *woses* will crush them
    easily. In spite of this, Fencers still have skirmsher, which means that
    they can sneak behind an injured unit and finish them off. Do not
    over-recruit them, as enemy *mages* will tear though their high defense.

* *Heavy Infantryman*: (**C-**) Usefulness similar to an archer. It's too slow
    to deal with most of the Rebel units, and it is owned by *Mages*, *woses*, and
    even archers. Even though it has a high damage potential and good
    resistances, because of its inherently low defense *shamans* can easily get
    hits on it and turn it into a piece of metal for a turn.

* *Horseman*: (**B**) One *horseman* may be nice, but no more than that. Enemy
    archers will tear them apart and *shamans* totally mess them up. They're
    expensive too. Their greatest use is probably killing *mages* or an archer
    that has gone slightly off-track.

    (**A-**) Again, when mobility is required, these units need to come and do
    serious damage. Since Rebels are mostly comprised of low-hp units,
    *horsemen* at day can usually rip them apart. Again be careful of archers,
    for this unit is worth 23 gold. Shield him properly if he is damaged.

* *Mage*: (**A-**) You'll need these guys to tear though those high elvish
    60-70% evasion in the forest; but be careful, archers and *shamans* will
    retaliate and some pretty nasty things may come from that. One purely
    positive thing though, they just absolutely destroy *woses*. 13-3 at day.
    Ouch. *mages* are expensive and fragile though, so keep them protected.

* *Merman Fighter*: (**B+**) If the map has a lot of water, maybe recruit a few
    to prevent the Rebel's Mermen Hunters from taking over the waters. Otherwise
    they don't really contribute much else.

* *Spearman* - **A** - A necessity. To defend at night, to kill pretty much
    anything except for *woses*, and to be cheap and cost only 14 gold. These
    guys pretty much tear though most of the Rebel units, if it were not only
    for the high-defense archer and *shaman*. Get a bunch, and move them like
    a wall against the enemy units.

At the start of the game, recruit 1-2 *cavalrymen*, depending on the map size,
1 *mage*, (1 *merman fighter* if you need some water coverage), maybe
1 *fencer*, and the rest *spearman*. Later on you maybe can recruit some
*horseman* if you opponent recruits mass *mages*, or more *cavalrymen* and
*mages* if he masses *woses*. Otherwise, *spearmen* and *mages* should help you
get through most of the match.

If you're going for speed, recruit 2-3 *cavalrymen*, depending on the map,
1 *horseman*, maybe 1 *fencer*, and the rest *spearmen*. Use your *spearmen* to
fill the holes and consolidate the territory that the horses took over. Use the
horses to outrun the archers and attack when they can.

## [Loyalists vs Northerners](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_play_Loyalists#Loyalists_vs_northerners)

The main problem you will have when facing [northerners](wesnoth_northerners.md)
are two things: poison and numbers. If northerners didn't have *assassins*, it
wouldn't be much of a big deal; you could out manoeuvre them with your superior
scouting units and skirmishers to grab their villages and then finish them off
one by one with *spearmen*/*bowmen*. Thing is, *assassins* poison makes defending at
night extremely difficult, and by poisoning your units, they often force you to
retreat and heal, or die due to retaliation. The key to winning this match up is
to use your superior versatility; the northerners greatest weakness is that ALL
of their units are very average and don't often have many special abilities; you
have masses. Use your first strike in *spearmen* to defend against *grunts*,
*trolls* and *wolfriders* (even at night), use your magic to finish off wounded
*assassins*, and you can charge any of their wounded units and kill them with one
hit. Since all of your units are lawful and theirs are chaotic, you'll want to
press your advantage at day and kill as much as possible (but don't attack
*assassins* with *bowmen*; you don't want to be poisoned and be forced to retreat in
your daytime assault). Another problem the northerners have is that all though
their units are many in number, they do not have a very high damage per hex
ratio. Use this to your advantage; travel in packs and use ZoC lines to prevent
your units from being swarmed too easily, and keep your vulnerable units like
*mages* behind damage soakers like *spearmen* or *heavy infantry*. If you can,
try and make night time defenses near rivers; northerners will hurt themselves
when they attack you, as they have low defense in water and are very annoyed by
deep water, because it prevents them from easily swarming you.

* *Spearmen*: (**A-**) Pretty much your best unit against northerners. Their
    first strike ability is great in defense and their attack power to cost
    ratio is quite high. They also have good health and can retaliate in ranged.
    As in many matchups, the bulk of your army.

* *Mage*: (**B+**) The *mage* is fragile and expensive and has a weak melee
    attack, which is the exact opposite of northerners. Not a great defender
    unless your opponent goes mad with assassins. However, they have lots of
    attack power at day and are very useful for nocking *trolls* of their
    perches and finishing off those damn *assassins*. You'll want a few of
    these, but make sure you keep them protected.

* *Bowmen*: (**B**) Good unit to have. They can attack *grunts* and *trolls*
    (although you'd want *mages* to attack *trolls*) without retaliation, and
    can defend against *assassins* in the night. They can also take out any
    wolves that stray too far from the main orchish army. They're not as good as
    *mages*, but they're cheaper and tougher.

* *Cavalryman*: (**B**) *cavalryman* are superior to their wolves and can hold
    ground against *grunts* and *trolls* reasonably well. It's also a good idea
    if your opponent likes to spam lots of *assassins*, to let them be the
    target of their poison; *cavalryman* and can run away and heal. Your *heavy
    infantrymen*? Not so much. Beware though, of the cheap orchish archer, as
    *cavalrymen* are weak to pierce.

* *Heavy Infantryman*: (**B-**) Heavy infantryman are heavily resistant to
    physical attacks like blade, pierce and to a lesser degree, impact. You'd
    think this would make them great units against northerners, if the orchish
    *archer* didn't have a ranged fire attack. *heavy infantrymen* are also much
    too slow too effectively deal with poison, and that's a 19 gold unit that
    can't fight. However, they are useful in defense if you opponent hasn't
    spammed many archers, and they can even be useful in attack to crush up
    injured *grunts*.

* *Horseman*: (**B**) The *horseman* is a little controversial in this matchup.
    northerners are cheap and melee orientated, which is exactly what *horseman*
    do badly against. They're also quite tough, which means one hit kills are
    rare. However, they have one very important advantage over the northerners-
    high damage per hex. A *horseman* is very useful for softening up units or
    outright killing them (particularly when paired with a mage) which will be
    important in breaking ZoC lines, which can be a real pain with all the units
    northerners can field. Get one or two, but no more, else it quickly produces
    diminishing returns.

* *Fencer*: (**C+**) The *fencer* is a melee based unit that is fragile against
    blade attacks of *grunts*, which means they don't have an awful lot of
    fighting effectiveness with them. On the other hand, the fencer's skirmisher
    ability is really valuable with the many northener units, and can finish off
    injured archers or go on sneaky village grabbing incursions. One or two
    might be useful, but no more, this unit is not a serious fighter! Make sure
    you keep them on 70% terrain if you can as well. Two hitter *grunts* can
    have trouble taking them out.

* *Merman Fighter*: (**C+**) Water based melee unit that doesn't do well against
    the orc *nagas*, recruit only if there's lots of water and keep them in
    defendible terrain, else they'll quickly be killed.

As usual, recruit *cavalrymen* and mermen depending on map (3-4 *cavalryman* for
larger maps, 2-3 for medium sized ones and probably no more than one or two for
small maps). Recruit plenty of *spearmen* and attack at day.

Speaking of that, make sure you travel in large groups and do not attack with
small numbers even at day. Northerners will swarm you too easily. Also, make
sure you don't overextend yourself at day, as northerners do a lot more damage
at night. Pay careful attention to your *mages*, they will be the ones the
northerners will be going after, so retreat them quickly. When defending, try to
avoid attacking units that can retaliate, unless you have a reasonably high
chance of killing them that turn. Avoid attacking *trolls* if you can't heavily
damage them or outright kill them, they're regenaration will quickly mean they
can heal from any scratches your *bowmen* might have dealt them.
