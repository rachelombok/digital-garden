[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29) is an
interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's
design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of
significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach
aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
projects.

# Interesting libraries to explore

* [parso](https://github.com/davidhalter/parso): Parses Python code.
* [kivi](https://kivy.org/): Create android/Linux/iOS/Windows applications with
    python. Use it with [kivimd](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD) to make it beautiful,
    check [the examples](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/Articles) and the
    [docs](https://kivymd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

    For beginner tutorials check the [real
    python's](https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/) and [towards data
    science](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-android-apps-with-python-part-1-603820bebde8?gi=9a0166808127)
    (and [part
    2](https://medium.com/swlh/building-android-apps-with-python-part-2-1d8e78ef9166)).
* [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise): Allows you to send
    a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services
    available to us today such as: Linux, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon SNS,
    Gotify, etc. Look at [all the supported
    notifications](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)
    `(¬º-°)¬`.
* [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess): Presents
    a simple interface, while running a full AsyncIO event loop on each child
    process, enabling levels of concurrency never before seen in a Python
    application. Each child process can execute multiple coroutines at once,
    limited only by the workload and number of cores available.
* [twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint): An advanced Twitter scraping
    & OSINT tool written in Python that doesn't use Twitter's API, allowing you
    to scrape a user's followers, following, Tweets and more while evading most
    API limitations.
* [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy): Twitter for Python.
