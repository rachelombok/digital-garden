[Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) is an extensible music server written
in Python.

The key features are:

* Plays music from many sources: local disk, Spotify, SoundCloud, Google Play Music, and
more.
* Can be used as a server: Out of the box, Mopidy is an HTTP server. If you
    install the [Mopidy-MPD](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/release-1.1/ext/mpd/)
    extension, it becomes an MPD server too. Given that MPD is a popular, old,
    and robust solution, you can benefit of the many solutions that exist out
    there for MPD.
* Edit the playlist from any phone, tablet, or computer using a variety of MPD
    and web clients.
* It supports [Beets](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-beets) as a library
    source.
* Is hackable: The awesome documentation, being Python based, the extension
    system, JSON-RPC, and JavaScript APIs make Mopidy a perfect base for your
    projects.
