# Check if an rsync command has gone well

Sometimes after you do an `rsync` between two directories of different devices
(an usb and your hard drive for example), the sizes of the directories don't
match. I've seen a difference of a 30% less on the destination. `du`, `ncdu` and
`and` have a long story of reporting wrong sizes with advanced filesystems (ZFS,
VxFS or compressing filesystems), these do a lot of things to reduce the disk
usage (deduplication, compression, extents, files with holes...) which may lead
to the difference in space.

To check if everything went alright run `diff -r --brief source/ dest/`, and
check that there is no output.

```bash
for file in /proc/*/status ; do awk '/VmSwap|Name/{printf $2 " " $3}END{ print ""}' $file; done | sort -k 2 -n -r | less
```
