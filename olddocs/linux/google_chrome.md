Although I hate it, there are web pages that don't work on Firefox or Chromium.
In those cases I install `google-chrome` and uninstall as soon as I don't need
to use that service.

# Installation

## [Debian](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-google-chrome-web-browser-on-debian-10/)

```bash
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```
