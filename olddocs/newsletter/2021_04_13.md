* New: [Sketch how to automate repetitive tasks prompted by email events.](projects.md#automate-email-management)

    Most of the emails I receive require repetitive actions that can be automated,
    I've stumbled upon [notmuchmail](https://notmuchmail.org/), which looks very
    promising. A friend suggested to use
    [afew](https://afew.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for tagging, and I'd probably use
    [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) to interact with the system (and finally be
    able to use email from the cli).

* Improvement: [Add interesting interface.](projects.md#quantified-self)

    For the interface [adri's memex](https://github.com/adri/memex) looks awesome!
    It's inspired in the Andrew Louis [talk Building
    a Memex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFWxvQn4cf8&t=1616s) whose [blog
    posts](https://hyfen.net/memex/) seems to be a gold mine.
    
    Also look at [hpi's compilation](https://github.com/hpi/hpi).

* New: [Sketch how to improve the launching of applications with i3wm.](projects.md#improve-the-way-of-launching-applications-with-i3wm)

    In the past I tried installing [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
    without success, I should try again. If the default features are not enough,
    check [adi1090x's custom resources](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi).

### [Plugin System](python_plugin_system.md)

* New: Add beets system as a first approach.

    When building Python applications, it's good to develop the core of your
    program, and allow extension via plugins.
    
    I still don't know how to do it, but [Beets plugin system](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/plugins.html)
    looks awesome for a first start.

### [Hushboard](husboard.md)

* New: Introduce Husboard.

    [Hushboard](https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/) is an utility that mutes your microphone while youâ€™re typing.
