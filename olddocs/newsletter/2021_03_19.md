### [Tabs vs Buffers](vim_tabs.md)

* New: Explain how to use tabs, buffers and windows in vim.

### [Vim Plugins](vim_plugins.md)

* New: Introduce vim-easymotion.

    EasyMotion provides a much simpler way to use some motions in vim. It
    takes the
    `<number>` out of `<number>w` or `<number>f{char}` by highlighting all
    possible
    choices and allowing you to press one key to jump directly to the target.
    
    When one of the available motions is triggered, all visible text preceding
    or
    following the cursor is faded, and motion targets are highlighted.

* Reorganization: Move vim-test to the plugins page.
