# Meta

# Arts

## [Writing](writing.md)

* New: Try vim-pencil without success, but love mdnav.

    [mdnav](https://github.com/chmp/mdnav) opens links to urls or files when
    pressing `enter` in normal mode over a markdown link, similar to `gx`
    but more powerful. I specially like the ability of following `[self
    referencing link][]` links, that allows storing the links at the bottom.

### [Digital Gardens](digital_garden.md)

* New: Introduce the digital garden concept.

    [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) is a method of
    storing and maintaining knowledge in an maintainable, scalable and
    searchable way. They are also known as second brains.
