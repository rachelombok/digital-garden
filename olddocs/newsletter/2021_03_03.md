# Coding

## Python

### [Code Styling](python_code_styling.md)

* Improvement: Don't use try-except to initialize dictionaries.

    Instead of:

    ```python
    try:
        dictionary['key']
    except KeyError:
        dictionary['key'] = {}
    ```

    Use:

    ```python
    dictionary.setdefault('key', {})
    ```

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: Add date management snippets.

    * [Get the week number of
        a datetime](python_snippets.md#get-the-week-number-of-a-datetime):
        `datetime.datetime(2010, 6, 16).isocalendar()[1]`.

    * [Get the Monday of a week
        number](python_snippets.md#get-the-monday-of-a-week-number):

      ```python
      import datetime
      d = "2013-W26"
      r = datetime.datetime.strptime(d + '-1', "%Y-W%W-%w")
      ```

    * [Get the month name from
        a number](python_snippets.md#get-the-month-name-from-a-number):.

      ```python
      import calendar

      >> calendar.month_name[3]
      'March'
      ```
    * [Get ordinal from number](python_snippets.md#get-ordinal-from-number)

      ```python
      def int_to_ordinal(number: int) -> str:
          '''Convert an integer into its ordinal representation.

          make_ordinal(0)   => '0th'
          make_ordinal(3)   => '3rd'
          make_ordinal(122) => '122nd'
          make_ordinal(213) => '213th'

          Args:
              number: Number to convert

          Returns:
              ordinal representation of the number
          '''
          suffix = ['th', 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th'][min(number % 10, 4)]
          if 11 <= (number % 100) <= 13:
              suffix = 'th'
          return f"{number}{suffix}"
      ```

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Vim Plugins](vim_plugins.md)

* New: [Follow the issue to add elipsis instead of ... in vim-abolish.](vim_plugins.md#issues)

### [mkdocs](mkdocs.md)

* New: Document the Navigation object and the on_nav event.

    Useful if you develop MkDocs plugins, it holds the information to build
    the navigation of the site.

# Arts

## Writing

### [Grammar and Orthography](orthography.md)

* New: [Explain where to add your pronouns.](orthography.md#where-to-add-your-pronouns)

    > Hi, I’m Lyz (he/him), I'm writing to tell you…

* New: [Explain when to capitalize after a question mark.](orthography.md#when-to-capitalize-after-a-question-mark)

    If the sentence ends after the question mark you should capitalize, if
    it
    doesn't end, you shouldn't have used the question mark, since it ends
    a sentence.

### [Writing Style](writing_style.md)

* New: [Analyze interesting books on writing style.](writing_style.md#writing-style-books)

    * The elements of style by William Strunk Jr and E.B White
    * On writing well by William Zinsser
    * Bird by bird by Anne Lamott
    * On writing by Stephen King

* New: [Explain how to end a letter.](writing_style.md#how-to-end-a-letter)

    Use Sincerely in doubt and Best if you have more confidence. Add a comma
    after the sign-off and *never* use Cheers (it's what I've been doing all
    my life `(◞‸◟；)` ).
