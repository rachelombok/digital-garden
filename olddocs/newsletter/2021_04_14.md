### [Beets](beets.md)

* New: Introduce Beets the music management library.

    [Beets](https://beets.io/) is a music management library used to get your music

    improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it
    provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

### [Modipy](modipy.md)

* New: Introduce the music server.

    [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) is an extensible music server written
    in Python, that plays perfectly with [beets](beets.md) and the MPD
    ecosystem.
    
    The awesome documentation, being Python based, the extension system,
    JSON-RPC, and JavaScript APIs make Mopidy a perfect base for your
    projects.
