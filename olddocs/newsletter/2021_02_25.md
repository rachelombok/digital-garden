### [Amazfit Band 5](amazfit_band_5.md)

* New: Add insights on sleep detection.

    The sleep tracking using Gadgetbridge is not [good at
    all](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Huami-Deep-Sleep-
    Detection).
    After two nights, the band has not been able to detect when I woke in the
    middle
    of the night, or when I really woke up, as I usually stay in the bed for a
    time
    before standing up. I'll try with the proprietary application soon and
    compare results.

* New: Explain how to upgrade the firmware.

    Gadgetbridge people have a [guide on how to upgrade the
    firmware](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Amazfit-
    Band-5-Firmware-Update),
    you need to get the firmware from the [geek doing
    forum](https://geekdoing.com/threads/amazfit-band-5-original-firmwares-
    resources-fonts.2331/)
    though, so it is interesting to create an account and watch the post.
