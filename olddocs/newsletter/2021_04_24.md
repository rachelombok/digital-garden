# [Projects](projects.md)

* New: [Improve the notification management in Linux.](projects.md#improve-the-notification-management-in-linux)

    Create new seed project to be able to group and silence the notifications under a custom logic.
    For example:
    
    * If I want to focus on a task, only show the most important ones.
    * Only show alerts once every X minutes. Or define that I want to receive them
        the first 10 minutes of every hour.
    * If I'm not working, silence all work alerts.

* New: [Improve the hard drive monitor system.](projects.md#improve-the-hard-drive-monitor-system)

    Create new seed project to use something like [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) (there's a [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-scrutiny)) to collect and display the information. For alerts, use one of their [supported providers](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny#notifications).

* New: [Aggregate all notifications.](projects.md#aggregate-all-notifications)

    Instead of reading the email, github, gitlab, discourse, reddit notifications,
    aggregate all in one place and show them to the user in a nice command line
    interface.
    
    For the aggregator server, my first choice would be [gotify](https://gotify.net/).

# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* New: Add apprise to the interesting libraries to explore.

    [apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise): Allows you to send
    a notification to almost all of the most popular notification services
    available to us today such as: Linux, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Amazon
    SNS, Gotify, etc. Look at [all the supported notifications](https://github.com/caronc/apprise#supported-notifications)
    `(¬º-°)¬`.
    

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Explain how to send raw data to the client.](fastapi.md#sending-data-to-the-client)

    With the [`Response`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/response-directly/#returning-a-custom-response) object.

# Other

* New: Improve the periodic tasks and application metrics monitoring.

    Setup an [healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io/) instance with the [linuxserver image](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-healthchecks) to monitor cronjobs.
    
    For the notifications either use the [prometheus metrics](https://healthchecks.io/docs/configuring_prometheus/) or an [apprise](https://github.com/healthchecks/healthchecks/issues/271) compatible system.
