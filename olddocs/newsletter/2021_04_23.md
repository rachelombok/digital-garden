### [Boto3](boto3.md)

    Also track the [issue to add support to launch templates](boto3.md#issues).

* New: [Explain how to test security groups.](boto3.md#test-security-groups)

### [Logging](python_logging.md)

* New: Explain how to log python program exceptions better than to a file.

    Using `logging` to write write exceptions and breadcrumbs to a file
    might not be the best solution because unless you look at it directly
    most errors will pass unnoticed.
    
    To actively monitor and react to code exceptions use an application monitoring
    platform like [sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/).
    
    In the article I explain what are the advantages of using this solution
    and do a comparison between Sentry and [GlitchTip](https://glitchtip.com).

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Explain how to log exceptions to sentry.](fastapi.md#logging-to-sentry)

### [Ruamel YAML](ruamel_yaml.md)
