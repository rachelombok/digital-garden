# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* New: [Add interesting links on how to write good documentation.](python.md#how-to-write-good-documentation)

    I would like to refactor
    [divio's](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) and
    [Vue's](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/contributing/writing-guide.html#principles)
    guidelines and apply it to my projects.

### [DeepDiff](deepdiff.md)

* Improvement: Add warning that regular expressions are not yet supported.

    Until [#239](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) is merged, the
    official library doesn't support searching for regular expressions. You can
    use [my fork](https://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff) instead.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Explain how to install dependencies from git repositories.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    With [pip you can](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16584552/how-to-state-in-requirements-txt-a-direct-github-source):
    
    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/path/to/repository@master
    ```
    
    If you want [to hard code it in your `setup.py`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32688688/how-to-write-setup-py-to-include-a-git-repository-as-a-dependency/54794506#54794506), you need to:
    
    ```python
    install_requires = [
      'some-pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/someorgname/pkg-repo-name@v1.1#egg=some-pkg',
    ]
    ```

### [sqlite3](sqlite3.md)

* New: [Explain how to implement the REGEXP operator with Python.](sqlite3.md#regexp)

## [SQLite](sqlite.md)

* New: [Explain how to configure sqlite to be able to use the REGEXP operator.](sqlite.md#regexp)

    It's not enabled by default.
