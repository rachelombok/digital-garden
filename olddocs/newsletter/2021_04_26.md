### [Boto3](boto3.md)

* Correction: [Add note that pagination is not yet supported when testing route53.](boto3.md#test-route53)

    I've [opened an issue](https://github.com/spulec/moto/issues/3879) to
    solve it.
    

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [Explain how to run tests in parallel.](pytest.md#running-tests-in-parallel)

    `pytest-xdist` makes it possible to run the tests in parallel, useful when the
    test suit is large or when the tests are slow.
    
    ```bash
    pip install pytest-xdist
    pytest -n auto
    ```
