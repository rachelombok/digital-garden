# [Projects](projects.md)

* Improvement: Explain the updates on the repository-orm project.

    In the latest version `0.2.0`, we added:
    
    * Support for the [TinyDB repository](https://lyz-code.github.io/repository-orm/tinydb_repository/).
    * Support for regular expressions in the `search` method.
    * Easier repository loading with `load_repository` function.

* Improvement: Add a link to the meilisearch [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).
* New: Create the quantified self project.

    With links to the two starting points [HPI](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) and [bionic](https://github.com/bionic-dev/bionic).
    

# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* Improvement: Add aiomultiprocess to the list of libraries to test.

    [aiomultiprocess](https://github.com/omnilib/aiomultiprocess): Presents
    a simple interface, while running a full AsyncIO event loop on each
    child process, enabling levels of concurrency never before seen in
    a Python application. Each child process can execute multiple coroutines
    at once, limited only by the workload and number of cores available.
    

* New: [Add interesting links on how to write good documentation.](python.md#how-to-write-good-documentation)

    I would like to refactor
    [divio's](https://documentation.divio.com/introduction/) and
    [Vue's](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/contributing/writing-guide.html#principles)
    guidelines and apply it to my projects.

### [Type Hints](type_hints.md)

* Improvement: Explain how to ignore a linter error and a type error.

    With `# type: ignore # noqa: W0212`

### [DeepDiff](deepdiff.md)

* Improvement: Add warning that regular expressions are not yet supported.

    Until [#239](https://github.com/seperman/deepdiff/pull/239) is merged, the
    official library doesn't support searching for regular expressions. You can
    use [my fork](https://github.com/lyz-code/deepdiff) instead.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Explain how to install dependencies from git repositories.](python_snippets.md#install-a-python-dependency-from-a-git-repository)

    With [pip you can](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16584552/how-to-state-in-requirements-txt-a-direct-github-source):
    
    ```bash
    pip install git+git://github.com/path/to/repository@master
    ```
    
    If you want [to hard code it in your `setup.py`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32688688/how-to-write-setup-py-to-include-a-git-repository-as-a-dependency/54794506#54794506), you need to:
    
    ```python
    install_requires = [
      'some-pkg @ git+ssh://git@github.com/someorgname/pkg-repo-name@v1.1#egg=some-pkg',
    ]
    ```

* Correction: Explain how to create PyPI valid packages with direct dependencies.

    It looks like PyPI don't want pip to reach out to URLs outside their
    site when installing from PyPI. So you can't define the direct
    dependencies in the `install_requires`. Instead you need to install them
    in a `PostInstall` custom script. Ugly as hell.

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* Improvement: Change parse_obj definition to find how to import pydantic models from dictionary.

### [sqlite3](sqlite3.md)

* New: [Explain how to implement the REGEXP operator with Python.](sqlite3.md#regexp)

### [TinyDB](tinydb.md)

* New: [Explain how to serialize datetime objects.](tinydb.md#serializing-custom-data)

## [SQLite](sqlite.md)

* New: [Explain how to configure sqlite to be able to use the REGEXP operator.](sqlite.md#regexp)

    It's not enabled by default.

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [Vim Plugins](vim_plugins.md)

* Correction: Typo.

    There was a missing comma in the list.

### [HAProxy](haproxy.md)

* New: Add interesting guidelines on [how to configure HAProxy in AWS](https://github.com/jvehent/haproxy-aws).

### [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.md)

* New: Introduce the program and multiple of it's uses.

    [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is a complete, cross-platform solution
    to record, convert and stream audio and video.

* Correction: Broken links.

    Removed the link to (everything_i_know.md) since it no longer exists. Updated some links that where broken due to a folder structure change.
