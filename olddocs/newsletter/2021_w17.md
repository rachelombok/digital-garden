# Coding

## [Python](python.md)

* New: Add parso library to interesting libraries to explore.

    [parso](https://github.com/davidhalter/parso) is a library to parse Python code.
    

### [Boto3](boto3.md)

* Correction: [Add note that pagination is not yet supported when testing route53.](boto3.md#test-route53)

    I've [opened an issue](https://github.com/spulec/moto/issues/3879) to
    solve it.
    

* New: [Explain how to test IAM users and groups.](boto3.md#test-iam-users)

### [Type Hints](type_hints.md)

* Improvement: [Explain how to define the type hints of functions and methods that use subclasses.](type_hints.md#allow-any-subclass)

    It's a complex topic that has taken me many months to get it right :).

### [Pytest](pytest.md)

* New: [Explain how to run tests in parallel.](pytest.md#running-tests-in-parallel)

    `pytest-xdist` makes it possible to run the tests in parallel, useful when the
    test suit is large or when the tests are slow.
    
    ```bash
    pip install pytest-xdist
    pytest -n auto
    ```

## [Writing good documentation](documentation.md)

* New: Start explaining how to write good documentation for a software project.

    It doesn't matter how good your program is, because if its documentation is not
    good enough, people will not use it.
    
    People working with software need different kinds of documentation at different
    times, in different circumstances, so good software documentation needs them
    all. In this first iteration, I define the five kinds of documentation,
    and give the ideas to write good introduction and get started sections.
