    * Support for regular expressions in the `search` method.
    * Easier repository loading with `load_repository` function.

* Improvement: Add a link to the meilisearch [blog](https://blog.meilisearch.com/).
* New: Create the quantified self project.

    With links to the two starting points [HPI](https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html) and [bionic](https://github.com/bionic-dev/bionic).

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* Correction: Explain how to create PyPI valid packages with direct dependencies.

    It looks like PyPI don't want pip to reach out to URLs outside their
    site when installing from PyPI. So you can't define the direct
    dependencies in the `install_requires`. Instead you need to install them
    in a `PostInstall` custom script. Ugly as hell.

# Operative Systems

## Linux

### [HAProxy](haproxy.md)

* New: Add interesting guidelines on [how to configure HAProxy in AWS](https://github.com/jvehent/haproxy-aws).

# Other

* Correction: Broken links.

    Removed the link to (everything_i_know.md) since it no longer exists. Updated some links that where broken due to a folder structure change.
