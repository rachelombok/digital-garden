It's important to create the documentation at the same time as you code your
project, otherwise you won't ever do it or you'll die trying.

Right now I use [mkdocs](mkdocs.md) with Github Pages for the documentation.

Follow the steps under [Installation](mkdocs.md#installation) to configure it.

!!! note ""
    I've automated the creation of the mkdocs site in [this cookiecutter
    template](https://github.com/lyz-code/cookiecutter-python-project).
