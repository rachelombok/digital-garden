[Yoyo](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest) is a database
schema migration tool. Migrations are written as SQL files or Python scripts
that define a list of migration steps.

# [Installation](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#installation)

```bash
pip install yoyo-migrations
```

# Usage

## [Command line](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#command-line-usage)

Start a new migration:

```bash
yoyo new ./migrations -m "Add column to foo"
```

Apply migrations from directory migrations to a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
yoyo apply --database postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/db ./migrations
```

Rollback migrations previously applied to a MySQL database:

```bash
yoyo rollback --database mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/database ./migrations
```

Reapply (ie rollback then apply again) migrations to a SQLite database at
location /home/sheila/important.db:

```bash
yoyo reapply --database sqlite:////home/sheila/important.db ./migrations
```

List available migrations:

```bash
yoyo list --database sqlite:////home/sheila/important.db ./migrations
```

By default, yoyo-migrations starts in an interactive mode, prompting you for
each migration file before applying it, making it easy to preview which
migrations to apply and rollback.

## [Connecting to the database](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#connecting-to-a-database)

Database connections are specified using a URL. Examples:

```python
# SQLite: use 4 slashes for an absolute database path on unix like platforms
database = sqlite:////home/user/mydb.sqlite

# SQLite: use 3 slashes for a relative path
database = sqlite:///mydb.sqlite

# SQLite: absolute path on Windows.
database = sqlite:///c:\home\user\mydb.sqlite

# MySQL: Network database connection
database = mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase

# MySQL: unix socket connection
database = mysql://scott:tiger@/mydatabase?unix_socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

# MySQL with the MySQLdb driver (instead of pymysql)
database = mysql+mysqldb://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase

# MySQL with SSL/TLS enabled
database = mysql+mysqldb://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase?ssl=yes&sslca=/path/to/cert

# PostgreSQL: database connection
database = postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydatabase

# PostgreSQL: unix socket connection
database = postgresql://scott:tiger@/mydatabase

# PostgreSQL: changing the schema (via set search_path)
database = postgresql://scott:tiger@/mydatabase?schema=some_schema
```

You can specify your database username and password either as part of the
database connection string on the command line (exposing your database password
in the process list) or in a configuration file where other users may be able to
read it.

The `-p` or `--prompt-password` flag causes yoyo to prompt for a password,
helping prevent your credentials from being leaked.

## [Migration files](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#migration-files)

The migrations directory contains a series of migration scripts. Each migration
script is a Python (.py) or SQL file (.sql).

The name of each file without the extension is used as the migrationâ€™s unique identifier.

Migrations scripts are run in dependency then filename order.

Each migration file is run in a single transaction where this is supported by the database.

Yoyo creates tables in your target database to track which migrations have been applied.


### [Migrations as Python scripts](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#migrations-as-python-scripts)

A migration script written in Python has the following structure:

```python
#
# file: migrations/0001_create_foo.py
#
from yoyo import step

__depends__ = {"0000.initial-schema"}

steps = [
  step(
      "CREATE TABLE foo (id INT, bar VARCHAR(20), PRIMARY KEY (id))",
      "DROP TABLE foo",
  ),
  step(
      "ALTER TABLE foo ADD COLUMN baz INT NOT NULL"
  )
]
```

The step function may take up to 3 arguments:

* `apply`: an SQL query (or Python function, see below) to apply the migration
    step.
* `rollback`: (optional) an SQL query (or Python function) to rollback the
    migration step.
* `ignore_errors`: (optional, one of `apply`, `rollback` or `all`) causes yoyo
    to ignore database errors in either the apply stage, rollback stage or
    both.


Migrations may declare dependencies on other migrations via the `__depends__`
attribute:

If you use the `yoyo new` command the `__depends__` attribute will be auto
populated for you.

#### [Migration steps as Python functions](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#migration-steps-as-python-functions)

If SQL is not flexible enough, you may supply a Python function as either or
both of the apply or rollback arguments of step. Each function should take
a database connection as its only argument:

```python
#
# file: migrations/0001_create_foo.py
#
from yoyo import step

def apply_step(conn):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(
        # query to perform the migration
    )

def rollback_step(conn):
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(
        # query to undo the above
    )

steps = [
  step(apply_step, rollback_step)
]
```

#### [Post-apply hook](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#post-apply-hook)

It can be useful to have a script that is run after every successful migration.
For example you could use this to update database permissions or re-create
views.

To do this, create a special migration file called `post-apply.py`.


## [Configuration file](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#configuration-file)

Yoyo looks for a configuration file named `yoyo.ini` in the current working
directory or any ancestor directory.

The configuration file may contain the following options:

```ini
[DEFAULT]

# List of migration source directories. "%(here)s" is expanded to the
# full path of the directory containing this ini file.
sources = %(here)s/migrations %(here)s/lib/module/migrations

# Target database
database = postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/mydb

# Verbosity level. Goes from 0 (least verbose) to 3 (most verbose)
verbosity = 3

# Disable interactive features
batch_mode = on

# Editor to use when starting new migrations
# "{}" is expanded to the filename of the new migration
editor = /usr/local/bin/vim -f {}

# An arbitrary command to run after a migration has been created
# "{}" is expanded to the filename of the new migration
post_create_command = hg add {}

# A prefix to use for generated migration filenames
prefix = myproject_
```

## [Calling Yoyo from Python code](https://ollycope.com/software/yoyo/latest/#calling-yoyo-from-python-code)

The following example shows how to apply migrations from inside python code:

```python
from yoyo import read_migrations
from yoyo import get_backend

backend = get_backend('postgres://myuser@localhost/mydatabase')
migrations = read_migrations('path/to/migrations')

with backend.lock():

    # Apply any outstanding migrations
    backend.apply_migrations(backend.to_apply(migrations))

    # Rollback all migrations
    backend.rollback_migrations(backend.to_rollback(migrations))
```
