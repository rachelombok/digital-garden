[Writing style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_style) is the manner of
expressing thought in language characteristic of an individual, period, school,
or nation. It's defined by the grammatical choices writers make, the importance
of adhering to norms in certain contexts and deviating from them in others, the
expression of social identity, and the emotional effects of particular devices
on audiences.

Beyond the essential elements of spelling, grammar, and punctuation, writing
style is the choice of words, sentence structure, and paragraph structure, used
to convey the meaning effectively.

The point of good writing style is to:

* Express the message to the reader simply, clearly, and convincingly.
* Keep the reader attentive, engaged, and interested.

Not to

* Display the writer's personality.
* Demonstrate the writer's skills, knowledge, or abilities.

# General writing principles

## Make it pleasant to the reader

[Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing) is a medium of communication, so avoid
introducing elements that push away the reader, such as:

* Spelling mistakes.
* Gender favoring, polarizing, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other unequal
    phrasing.
* Ugly environment: Present your texts through a pleasant medium such as
    a [mkdocs](mkdocs.md) webpage.
* Write like you talk: Ask yourself, *[is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to
    a friend?](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html)*. If it isn't, imagine what you would
    say, and use that instead.
* Format errors: If you're writing in markdown, make sure that the result has no display
    bugs.
* Write short articles: Even though I love [Gwern
    site](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content), I find it daunting most of times.
    Instead of a big post, I'd rather use multiple well connected articles.

## [Saying more with less](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/writing#saying-more-with-less)

Never use a long word where a short one will do. Replace words like `really
like` with `love` or other more appropriate words that save space writing and
are more meaningful.

Don't use filler words like *really*.

## [Be aware of pacing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/writing#be-aware-of-pacing)

Be aware of pacing between words and sentences. The sentences ideally should
flow into one another. Breaks in form of commas and full steps are important, as
they allow for the reader to take a break and absorb the point that you tried to
deliver. Try to use less tan 30 words per sentence.

For example, change *Due to the fact that* to *because*.

## [One purpose](https://github.com/mnielsen/notes-on-writing/blob/master/notes_on_writing.md)

A good piece of writing has a single, sharp, overriding purpose. Every part of
the writing, even the digressions, should serve that purpose. Put another
way, clarity of the general purpose is an absolute requirement in a good piece of
writing.

This observation matters because it's often tempting to let your purpose
expand and become vague. Writing a piece about gardens? Hey, why not include
that important related thought you had about rainforests? Now you have
a piece that's sort of about gardens and sort of about rainforests, and not
really about anything. The reader can no longer bond to it.

A complicating factor is that sometimes you need to explore beyond the
boundaries of your current purpose. You're writing for purpose A, but your
instinct says that you need to explore subject B. Unfortunately, you're not
yet sure how subject B fits in. If that's the case then you must take time
to explore, and to understand how, if at all, subject B fits in, and whether
you need to revise your purpose. This is emotionally difficult. It creates
uncertainty, and you may feel as though your work on subject B is wasted
effort. These doubts must be resisted.

## Avoid using clichés

[Clichés prevent readers from
visualization](https://writingcooperative.com/the-real-reason-you-shouldnt-use-clich%C3%A9s-3f4793899c7f),
making them an obstacle to creating memorable writing.

## Citing the sources

* If it's a small phrase or a refactor, link the source inside the phrase or at
    the header of the section.
* If it's a big refactor, add it to a [references](#references) section.
* If it's a big block without editing use admonition quotes



## Take all the guidelines as suggestions

All the sections above are guidelines, not rules to follow blindly, I try to
adhere to them as much as possible, but if I feel it doesn't apply I ignore
them.

## Unconnected thoughts

* Replace adjectives with data. *Nearly all of* -> *84% of*.
* Remove [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word).
* Most adverbs are superfluous. When you say "generally" or
  "usually" you're probably undermining your point and the use of "very" or
  "extremely" are hyperbolic and breathless and make it easier to regard what
  you're writing as not serious.
* Examine every word: a surprising number don't serve any purpose.
* While wrapping your content into a story you may find yourself talking about
  your achievements more than giving actionable advice. If that happens, try to
  get to the bottom of how you achieved these achievements and break this process
  down, then focus on the process more than on your personal achievement.
* Set up a system that prompts people to review the material.
* Don't be egocentric, limit the use of `I`, use the implied subject instead:
    *It's where I go to* -> *It's the place to go.*
    *I take different actions* -> *Taking different actions*.
* Don't be possessive, use `the` instead of `my`.
* If you don't know how to express something use services like
    [deepl](https://www.deepl.com).
* Use synonyms instead of repeating the same word over and over.
* Think who are you writing to.
* Use *active voice*: Active voice ensures that the actors are identified and it
  generally leaves less open questions. The exception is if you want to
  emphasize the object of the sentence.

# [How to end a letter](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-end-a-letter-2062308)

How you end a letter is important. It’s your last chance to leave the reader
with positive feelings about you and the letter you have written. To make
the matter more difficult, each different closing phrase has subtle connotations
attached to them that you need to know to use them well.

Most formal letter closing options are reserved, but note that there are degrees
of warmth and familiarity among the options. Your relationship with the person
to whom you’re writing will shape which closing you choose:

* If you don’t know the individual to whom you’re writing, stick with
    a professional formal closing.
* If you’re writing to a colleague, business connection, or someone else you
    know well, it’s fine to close your letter less formally.

Above all, your closing should be appropriate. Ideally, your message will
resonate instead of your word choice.

!!! note "TL;DR: You can select from:"

    * *Simplest, most useful*:
        * Sincerely
        * Regards
        * Yours truly
        * Yours sincerely

    * *Slightly more personal*:
        * Best regards
        * Cordially
        * Yours respectfully

    * *More personal*: Only use when appropriate to the letter's content.
        * Warm regards
        * Best wishes
        * With appreciation

    * *Letter closings to avoid*:
        * Always
        * Cheers
        * Love
        * Take Care
        * XOXO

The following are letter closings that are appropriate for business and
employment related letters.

* *Sincerely, Regards, Yours truly, and Yours sincerely*: These are the simplest
    and most useful letter closings to use in a formal business setting. These
    are appropriate in almost all instances and are excellent ways to close
    a cover letter or an inquiry.

* *Best regards, Cordially, and Yours respectfully*: These letter closings fill
    the need for something slightly more personal. They are appropriate once you
    have some knowledge of the person to whom you are writing. You may have
    corresponded via email a few times, had a face-to-face or phone interview,
    or met at a networking event.

* *Warm regards, Best wishes, and With appreciation*: These letter closings are
    also appropriate once you have some knowledge or connection to the person to
    whom you are writing. Because they can relate back to the content of the
    letter, they can give closure to the point of the letter. Only use these if
    they make sense with the content of your letter.

## Letter closings to avoid

There are certain closings that you want to avoid in any business letter. Most
of these are simply too informal. Some examples of closings to avoid are listed
below:

Always, Cheers, Love, Take care, XOXO, Talk soon, See ya, Hugs

Some closings (such as “Love” and “XOXO”) imply a level of closeness that is not
appropriate for a business letter.

*Rule of thumb*: if you would use the closing in a note to a close friend, it’s
probably not suitable for business correspondence.

## Punctuating Farewell Phrases

When writing your sign-off, it's important to remember to use proper
capitalization and punctuation. Only the first word should be capitalized (e.g.,
Yours truly), and the sign-off should be followed by a comma (or an exclamation
mark in some informal settings), not a period.

## Postscripts

A P.S. (or postscript) comes after your sign-off and name. It is meant to
include material that is supplementary, subordinated, or not vital to your
letter. It is best to avoid postscripts in formal writing, as the information
may go unnoticed or ignored; in those cases, try to include all information in
the body text of the letter.

n casual and personal correspondences, a postscript is generally acceptable.
However, try to limit it to include only humorous or unnecessary material.

## [Letter closings in detail](https://www.scribendi.com/academy/articles/how_to_end_a_letter.en.html)

### Sincerely

Sincerely (or sincerely yours) is often the go-to sign off for formal letters,
and with good reason. This ending restates the sincerity of your letter's
intent; it is a safe choice if you are not overly familiar with the letter's
recipient, as it's preferable to use a sign-off that is both common and formal
in such a situation.

### Best

Ending your letter with best, all the best, all best, or best wishes indicates
that you hope the recipient experiences only good things in the future. Although
it is not quite as formal as sincerely, it is still acceptable as a polite,
formal/semi-formal letter ending, proper for business contacts as well as
friends.

### Best regards

Quite like the previous sign-off, best regards expresses that you are thinking
of the recipient with the best of feelings and intentions. Despite its
similarity to best, this sign-off is a little more formal, meant for business
letters and unfamiliar contacts. A semi-formal variation is warm regards, and an
even more formal variation is simply regards.

### Speak to you soon

Variations to this farewell phrase include see you soon, talk to you later, and
looking forward to speaking with you soon. These sign-offs indicate that you are
expecting to continue the conversation with your contact. It can be an effective
ending to a letter or email when confirming or planning a specific date for
a face-to-face meeting.

Although these endings can be used in either formal or casual settings, they
typically carry a more formal tone. The exception here is talk to you later,
which errs on the more casual side.

### Thanks

This is an effective ending to a letter when you are sincerely expressing
gratitude. If you are using it as your standard letter ending, however, it can
fall flat; the reader will be confused if there is no reason for you to be
thanking them. Try to use thanks (or variations such as thanks so much, thank
you, or thanks!) and its variations only when you think you haven't expressed
your gratitude enough; otherwise, it can come across as excessive.

Furthermore, when you're issuing an order, thanks might not be the best sign-off
because it can seem presumptuous to offer thanks before the task has even been
accepted or begun.

### [No sign-off]

Having no sign-off for your letter is a little unusual, but it is acceptable in
some cases. Omitting the sign-off is most appropriately used in cases where you
are replying to an email chain. However, in a first email, including neither
a sign-off nor your name will make your letter seem to end abruptly. It should
be avoided in those situations or when you are not very familiar with the
receiver.

### Yours truly

This is where the line between formal and informal begins to blur. Yours truly
implies the integrity of the message that precedes your name, but it also
implies that you are related to the recipient in some way.

This ending can be used in various situations, when writing letters to people
both familiar and unfamiliar to you; however, yours truly carries a more casual
and familiar tone, making it most appropriate for your friends and family. It's
best used when you want to emphasize that you mean the contents of your letter.

### Take care

Take care is also a semi-formal way to end your letter. Like the sign-off all
the best, this ending wishes that no harm come to the reader; however, like
ending your letter with yours truly, the word choice is less formal and implies
that the writer is at least somewhat familiar with the reader.

### Cheers

Cheers is a lighthearted ending that expresses your best wishes for the reader.
Due to its association with drinking alcohol, it's best to save this sign-off
for cases where you are familiar with the reader and when the tone is optimistic
and casual. Also note that because cheers is associated with British English, it
may seem odd to readers who speak other styles of English and are not very
familiar with the term.

# Style issues

## [Avoid there is at the start of the sentence](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/157830/why-should-sentences-not-start-with-there-is-or-there-are)

Almost never begin a sentence with “It is...” or “There is/are...”. These are
examples of unnecessary verbiage that shift the focus from the sentence point.

# [Writing style books](https://contentfiesta.com/books-on-writing/)

After you start writing every day professionally, you will see that you will
face some hard problems that will haunt you every time you sit down to write.

The simplest way to overcome these issues and adopt a philosophy of writing that
will make you a more professional, resilient, and wiser writer is to read the
books about writing that masters of the craft have published.

After reviewing [1](https://contentfiesta.com/books-on-writing/),
[2](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/books-that-improve-writing-skills/) and
[3](https://www.forbes.com/sites/micahsolomon/2016/02/01/three-essential-books-that-will-immediately-improve-your-writing/)
I've come to the following list of books I'd like to read.

## [The elements of style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)

A classic book on grammar, style, and punctuation. If you feel like you need to
improve any of those three aspects of your writing, then this book is a great
start.

With only 85 pages it covers both the grammar basics, rules that affect the
style composition, writing toolbox description, and styling recommendations.

## [On writing well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well)

They say this book is specially useful to find one's style, develop it, polish
it and learn how to write with it.

The author doesn't get too philosophical or cutesy in his concepts, neither he
gets too technical. In a way, it provides the right balance between [The
Elements of Style](#the-elements-of-style) and [Bird by Bird](bird-by-bird).
Reading the book feels like you’re being mentored by a wise, highly experienced
writer.

## [Bird by bird](https://archive.org/details/birdbybirdsomein00lamo)

Supposedly the most touching, poetic, and psychological book of the collection.

The first part of the book lays around the life of Anne Lamott, a relatively
popular fiction writer, who happens to have had a quite interesting life. Just
like On Writing (the first book mentioned in here), the author manages to share
enough of her life to enlighten the story and thesis of the book.

The author explains what it takes to be a writer, what it means to be one, and
how you can develop a narrative for a fiction book or story.

It looks like it's a real pleasure to read it at the same time as it’s still
a wonderful experience that will help you understand how you can overcome your
own fears, doubts, and pains of writing.

Whether you want to write fiction or nonfiction, Bird by Bird provides
a beautiful reading experience that will teach you what it takes to be a writer
and how to find your demons.

## [On writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing:_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft)

It's a book written by Stephen King that even though I haven't read any of his
books I know he is known for being a specialist in capturing the reader. I don't
know if it's going to be too much oriented to writing novels, but it looks
promising.

I'll leave it there for now, but keep on reading on [Ivan Kreimer's
article](https://contentfiesta.com/books-on-writing/) for more suggestions.
