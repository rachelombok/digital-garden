[Scaling and root
planing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_and_root_planing), also known as
conventional periodontal therapy, non-surgical periodontal therapy or deep
cleaning, is a procedure involving removal of dental plaque and calculus
(scaling or debridement) and then smoothing, or planing, of the (exposed)
surfaces of the roots, removing cementum or dentine that is impregnated with
calculus, toxins, or microorganisms, the etiologic agents that cause
inflammation. It is a part of non-surgical periodontal therapy. This helps to
establish a periodontium that is in remission of periodontal disease.

As to the frequency of cleaning, research on this matter is inconclusive. That
is, it has neither been shown that more frequent cleaning leads to better
outcomes nor that it does
not. Thus, any general recommendation for a frequency of routine cleaning (e.g.
every six months, every year) has no empirical basis.

# [Why do we need deep cleaning](https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/do-you-need-deep-dental-cleaning-dentists-discuss-t127590)

We all have a plethora of bacteria in our mouths. Those bacteria mix with other
substances to form sticky plaque on teeth, which is mostly banished by regular
brushing and flossing.

Plaques that don't get brushed away can harden and form a substance known as
tartar, which can only be removed with a dental cleaning. When tartar remains on
the teeth, it can cause inflammation of the gums, a condition called gingivitis,
characterized by red swollen gums that can bleed easily. A mild form of gum
disease, gingivitis can usually be reversed through regular brushing and
flossing along with cleanings by a dentist or hygienist.

If gingivitis isn't cured, it can advance to a more severe form of gum disease
called periodontitis, in which the inflamed tissue begins to pull away from the
teeth, forming spaces, or pockets. As the pockets become deeper, more of the
tooth below the gum line is exposed to bacteria, which can damage the bone
holding teeth in place.

Eventually, if the pockets become deep enough, teeth can become loose and may
even be lost. Dentists measure the depth of the pockets with a probe that has
a tiny ruler on the end. Healthy gums have pockets that measure no more than
3 mm — or a little less than a tenth of an inch — deep. More than that and
you’re getting into trouble.

One way to slow or halt the process is through deep cleaning, which removes the
plaque below the gum line and smooths rough spots on the tooth root, making it
harder for bacteria to accumulate there.

# [Signs of periodontitis](https://www.today.com/series/one-small-thing/do-you-need-deep-dental-cleaning-dentists-discuss-t127590)

* Red or swollen gums
* Tender or bleeding gums
* Persistent bad breath
* Your teeth look like they’ve been getting longer as gums recede.
* Teeth that are sensitive
* Loose teeth
* Pain when chewing

# [Evidence-based dentistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_and_root_planing)

[Several systematic reviews have been
made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_and_root_planing) of the
effectiveness of scaling and root planing as evidence-based dentistry.
A Cochrane review by [Worthington et al. in 2013](http://www.cochrane.org/CD004625/ORAL_routine-scale-and-polish-for-periodontal-health-in-adults) considered only scaling and
polishing of the teeth, but not root planing. After examining 88 papers they
found only three studies that met all their requirements, remarking that "the
quality of the evidence was generally low."

An extensive review that did involve root planing was published by the [Canadian
Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health in 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0090138/).
It made a number of findings, including (1) In five randomized controlled
trials, scaling and root planing "was associated with a decrease in plaque from
baseline at one month, three months, or six months;" and (2) Four studies
analyzed changes in the gingival index (GI) from the baseline and "found
a significant improvement from baseline in the scaling and root planing group at
three months and six months." This study also discussed evidence-based
guidelines for frequency of scaling with and without root planing for patients
both with and without chronic periodontitis. The group that produced one of the
main systematic reviews used in the 2016 Canadian review has published
guidelines based on its findings. They recommend that scaling and root
planing (SRP) should be considered as the initial treatment for patients with
chronic periodontitis. They note that "the strength of the recommendation is
limited because SRP is considered the reference standard and thus used as an
active control for periodontal trials and there are few studies in which
investigators compare SRP with no treatment." They add however that "root
planing ... carries the risk of damaging the root surface and potentially
causing tooth or root sensitivity. Generally expected post-SRP procedural
adverse effects include discomfort."

Enamel cracks, early caries and resin restorations can be damaged during scaling.

# [Effectiveness of the procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaling_and_root_planing)

A scaling and root planing procedure is to be considered effective if the
patient is subsequently able to maintain their periodontal health without
further bone or attachment loss and if it prevents recurrent infection with
periodontal pathogens.

The long term effectiveness of scaling and root planing depends upon a number of
factors. These factors include patient compliance, disease progress at the time
of intervention, probing depth, and anatomical factors like grooves in the roots
of teeth, concavities, and furcation involvement which may limit visibility of
underlying deep calculus and debris.

First and foremost, periodontal scaling and root planing is a procedure that
must be done thoroughly and with attention to detail in order to ensure complete
removal of all calculus and plaque from involved sites. If these causative
agents are not removed, the disease will continue to progress and further damage
will result. In cases of mild to moderate periodontitis, scaling and root
planing can achieve excellent results if the procedure is thorough. As
periodontitis increases in severity, a greater amount of supporting bone is
destroyed by the infection. This is illustrated clinically by the deepening of
the periodontal pockets targeted for cleaning and disinfection during the
procedure. Once the periodontal pockets exceed 6 mm in depth, the effectiveness
of deposit removal begins to decrease, and the likelihood of complete healing
after one procedure begins to decline as well. The more severe the infection
prior to intervention, the greater the effort required to arrest its progress
and return the patient to health. Diseased pockets over 6 mm can be resolved
through periodontal flap surgery.

Although healing of the soft tissues will begin immediately following removal of
the microbial biofilm and calculus that cause the disease, scaling and root
planing is only the first step in arresting the disease process. Following
initial cleaning and disinfection of all affected sites, it is necessary to
prevent the infection from recurring. Therefore, patient compliance is, by far,
the most important factor, having the greatest influence on the success or
failure of periodontal intervention. Immediately following treatment, the
patient will need to maintain excellent oral care at home. With proper homecare,
which includes but is by no means limited to brushing twice daily for 2–3
minutes, flossing daily and use of mouthrinse, the potential for effective
healing following scaling and root planing increases. Commitment to and
diligence in the thorough completion of daily oral hygiene practices are
essential to this success.

The process which allows for the formation of deep periodontal pockets does not
occur overnight. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect the tissue to heal
completely in a similarly short time period. Gains in gingival attachment may
occur slowly over time, and ongoing periodontal maintenance visits are usually
recommended (by some sources).

# Side effects

The process carries it's risks, such as:

* Pop out a filling
* Gums damage in an irreversible way.
* End up with an abscess if a tiny piece of tartar is knocked loose and becomes
    trapped.
* Have more sensitivity after the procedure.

# Conclusion

* Deep cleaning is an invasive procedure
* There is a lack of scientific studies supporting the frequency of it's
    application, specially for people that doesn't suffer from periodontitis.
* It's an expensive procedure.

So, ask the opinion of two or three independent dentists before
doing a deep clean.
