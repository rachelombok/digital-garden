[Northerners](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Northerners) are a faction of
[Orcs](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Orcs) and their allies who live in the north of
the Great Continent, thus their name. Northerners consist of the warrior orcs
race, the enslaved goblins, trolls who are tricked into combat by the orcs, and
the serpentine naga. The Northerners play best by taking advantage of having
many low-cost and high HP soldiers.
