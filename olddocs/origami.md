[Origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origami), is the art of paper folding,
it comes from ori meaning "folding", and kami meaning "paper" (kami changes to
gami due to rendaku)). In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an
inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.
The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture
through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally
discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper.
