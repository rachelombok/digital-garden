[Labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/)
are identifying metadata key/value pairs attached to objects, such as pods.
Labels are intended to give meaningful and relevant information to users, but
which do not directly imply semantics to the core system.

```yaml
"labels": {
  "key1" : "value1",
  "key2" : "value2"
}
```
