There are several tools built to enhance the operation, installation and use of
Kubernetes.

## Tried

* [K3s](https://k3s.io): Recommended small kubernetes, like hyperkube.

## To try

* [crossplane](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane): Crossplane is an
  open source multicloud control plane. It introduces workload and resource
  abstractions on-top of existing managed services that enables a high degree of
  workload portability across cloud providers. A single crossplane enables the
  provisioning and full-lifecycle management of services and infrastructure
  across a wide range of providers, offerings, vendors, regions, and clusters.
  Crossplane offers a universal API for cloud computing, a workload scheduler,
  and a set of smart controllers that can automate work across clouds.
* [razee](https://razee.io): A multi-cluster continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
  Automate the rollout process of Kubernetes resources across multiple clusters,
  environments, and cloud providers, and gain insight into what applications and
  versions run in your cluster.
* [kube-ops-view](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-ops-view): it shows how are
  the ops on the nodes.
* [kubediff](https://github.com/weaveworks/kubediff): a tool for Kubernetes to
  show differences between running state and version controlled configuration.
* [ksniff](https://github.com/eldadru/ksniff): A kubectl plugin that utilize
  tcpdump and Wireshark to start a remote capture on any pod in your Kubernetes
  cluster.
* [kubeview](https://learnk8s.io/visualise-dependencies-kubernetes/): Visualize
  dependencies kubernetes.
