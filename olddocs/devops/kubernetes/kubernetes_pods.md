[Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) are the basic
building block of Kubernetes, the smallest and simplest unit in the object model
that you create or deploy. A Pod represents a running process on your cluster.

A Pod represents a unit of deployment. It encapsulates:

* An application container (or, in some cases, multiple tightly coupled containers).
* Storage resources.
* A unique network IP.
* Options that govern how the container(s) should run.
