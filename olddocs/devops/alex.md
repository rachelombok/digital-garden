[Alex](https://github.com/get-alex/alex) helps you find gender favoring,
polarizing, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other unequal phrasing in
text.

For example, `when Weâ€™ve confirmed his identity is given`, `alex` will warn you and
suggest using `their` instead of `his`.

Give alex a spin on the [Online demo](http://alexjs.com/#demo).

# Installation

```bash
npm install alex --global
```

You can use it with Vim through the [ALE plugin](vim_plugins.md#ale).

As of 2020-07-14, there is no pre-commit available. So I'm going to use it as
a soft linter.
