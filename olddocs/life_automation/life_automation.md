Life Automation is the act of analyzing your interactions with the world to find
ways to reduce the time or willpower spent on unwanted processes.

Once you've covered some minimum life requirements (health, money or
happiness), time is your most valued asset. It's sad to waste it doing stuff
that we need but don't increase our happiness. So the idea is to identify which
are those processes and find optimizations that allows us to do them in less
time or using less willpower.

I've also faced the problem of having so much stuff in my mind. Having
background processes increase your brain load and are a constant sink of
willpower. As a result, when you really need that CPU time, your brain is tired
and doesn't work to it's full performance. Automating processes, like life
logging and task management, allows you to delegate those worries.

Life automation can lead to [habit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit)
building, which reduces even more the willpower consumption of processes, at the
same time it reduces the error rate.

# Automating life management

* [Week automation](week_automation.md), or how to review and plan the week.

# Automating home chores

* Using Grocy to maintain the house stock, shopping lists and meal
  plans.

# Automating computer file management

Today I've stumbled upon [organize](https://organize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
looks good for automating processes on files. Maybe it's interesting to run it
with [inotifywait](https://askubuntu.com/a/819290) instead of with a [cron
job](https://github.com/tfeldmann/organize/issues/18).
