I try to keep my mind as empty as possible of non relevant processes, that's why
I use a task manager to handle my tasks and meetings. This system has a side
effect, if there isn't something reminding you that you have to do something,
you fail to do it. That principle applied to human relationships means
that if you don't stumble that person in your daily life, it doesn't exist for
you and you will probably not take enough care that the person deserves.

To solve that problem I started creating periodic tasks to call these people or
hang out. I've also used those tasks to keep a diary of the interactions.

Recently I've found [Monica](monica.md) a popular open source personal CRM that
helps in the same direction.

So I'm going to migrate all my information to the system and see how it goes.
