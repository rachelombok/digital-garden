[Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) is a method of storing
 and maintaining knowledge in an maintainable, scalable and searchable way. They
 are also known as second brains.

Unlike in common blogging where you write an article and forget about it, posts
are treated as plants in various stages of growth and nurturing. Some might
wither and die, and others will flourish and provide a source of continued
knowledge for the gardener and folks in the community that visit.

The content is diverse, you can find ideas, articles, investigations, snippets,
resources, thoughts, collections, and other bits and pieces that I find
interesting and useful.

It's my personal [Stock](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890), the content that’s
as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people
discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over
time.

They are a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on
the resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to
get there.

# Existing digital gardens

If you look for inspiration check my favourite digital gardens:

* [Nikita's Everything I know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz): It's awesome
    both in content quality and length, as the way he presents it.
* [Gwern's site](https://www.gwern.net/index): The way he presents content is
    unique and gorgeous. I've found myself not very hooked to the content, but
    when you find something you like it's awesome, such as the [about
    page](https://www.gwern.net/About), his article on
    [spaced repetition](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition) or the essay
    of [Death Note: L, Anonymity & Eluding
    Entropy](https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity).
