[Rebels](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Rebels) are a faction of
[Elves](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Elves) and their various forest-dwelling
allies. They get their human name, Rebels, from the time of Heir to the Throne,
when they started the rebellion against the evil Queen Asheviere. Elves are
a magical race that are masters of the bow and are capable of living many years
longer than humans. In harmony with nature, the elves find allies with the human
mages, certain merfolk, and tree creatures called woses. Rebels are best played
taking advantage of their high forest defense, mastery of ranged attacks, and
the elves' neutral alignment.
