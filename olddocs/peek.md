[Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) is a simple animated GIF screen recorder
with an easy to use interface.

# [Installation](https://github.com/phw/peek#installation)

```bash
sudo apt-get install peek
```

If you try to use it with i3, you're going to have a bad time, you'd [need to
install](https://github.com/phw/peek#on-i3-the-recording-area-is-all-black-how-can-i-record-anything)
[Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton), and then the elements [may not even
be
clickable](https://github.com/phw/peek#why-cant-i-interact-with-the-ui-elements-inside-the-recording-area).
