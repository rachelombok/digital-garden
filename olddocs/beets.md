[Beets](https://beets.io/) is a music management library used to get your music
collection right once and for all. It catalogs your collection, automatically
improving its metadata as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it
provides a set of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

Through plugins it supports:

* Fetch or calculate all the metadata you could possibly need: album art,
    lyrics, genres, tempos,
    [ReplayGain](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/replaygain.html)
    levels, or acoustic fingerprints.
* Get metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, or Beatport. Or guess metadata using
    songsâ€™ filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.
* Transcode audio to any format you like.
* Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums that are
    missing tracks.
* Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play it in any
    browser that supports HTML5 Audio.

Still, if beets doesn't do what you want yet, [writing your own
plugin](http://beets.readthedocs.org/page/dev/plugins.html) is easy if you
know a little Python. Or you can use it as
a [library](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/api.html).
