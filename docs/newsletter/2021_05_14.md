### [Configure Docker to host the application](docker.md)

* New: Explain how to log in using pass.

    ```bash
    pass show dockerhub | docker login --username foo --password-stdin
    ```

* New: Explain how not to store the credentials in plaintext.

    It doesn't work, don't go this painful road and assume that docker is broken.
    
    The official steps are horrible, and once you've spent two hours debugging
    them, you [won't be able to push or pull images with your
    user](https://github.com/docker/docker-credential-helpers/issues/154).

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: [Explain how to deploy it using Docker.](fastapi.md#deploy-with-docker)
* New: [Explain how to show logging messages in the logs.](fastapi.md#logging)
