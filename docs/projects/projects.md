This is where I primarily keep my project ideas that are either in motion, launched, or just "seedlings". Constantly growing and changing.

JustShoot is a community platform for photo enthusiasts to find cool locations for photo shoots. You can browse the map and search for snap spots posted by the JustShoot community. Get inspired by photographers in the area, find great spots to take photos, and share your own.

The result is a collaborative open community and platform for photography enthusiasts, both amateur and professional.

The Pink Effect is the phenomenon of BLACKPINKâ€™s numbers, popularity and demand. BLACKPINK are the most famous K-Pop girl group and are currently the most popular girl group in the world, and have risen to global acclaim quickly because of peopleâ€™s infatuation. They have commercial appeal that ranges from music to brand deals. This project analyzes why they are the biggest K-POP girl group.
