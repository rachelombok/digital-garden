## Creating a Visual Novel in Unity

These are notes on how to create a visual novel in Unity, based on this [tutorial](https://codyclaborn.me/tutorials/creating-a-visual-novel-in-unity/).

### Planning
* Intro: Decide what features you want to have, so that creating code later on will be easier and more efficient.
* Road Map: A roadmap outlines the entire game and what you will need at each step.
* Scenes: Think of these as the chapters to our visual novel. The scenes will hold the dialogue information for each encounter that you decide to create.
* Characters: You can’t have a “visual” novel without having characters. The characters will contain the information about their art and different possible poses.
* Dialog: What good is a character if it can’t say anything? The dialog will be our script that the players will end up reading.
* Choices: Choices are what separates a game from other forms of media and lest the player interact with the game. The choices will go hand in hand with the dialog to allow the player to experience a dynamic story.

### Visual Aspects

* Background Art: If you just take real pictures and use a watercolor filter to save money on backgrounds, they are still important. It's a lot of work, but hand drawn sprites just look better on hand drawn backgrounds. Furthermore, with self-created backgrounds, you can create your own unique atmosphere.
* Character Sprites: Each major character of your visual novel will probably have around a dozen sprites. It's reccomended for beginner's to avoid using too many characters
* Computer Graphics: These are still images made to appear when certain scenes occur. These images are best used to convey events that cannot be shown accurately simply by moving the character sprites.
* Special Effects: Visual effects cannot be used by physical books but can be used by visual novels. A flash here or falling snow there, can easily enhance the amount of emotion of any given scene. Even something as simple as moving a sprite left or right or the way the text is shown on the screen is important!
* Background Music:  The background music has to complement and enhance the text it is behind. Describing a soothing Slice of Life scene? Then use calming music! An action scene? Heavy Metal, of course! A Plot Twist goes great with Ominous Latin Chanting, and so on.
* Sound Effects: As with any audiovisual media, a well placed sound effect can have a great impact.
