This is my personal digital garden, where I document some of my half baked ideas, and take notes on topics I am interested in.

Unlike my blog, this site is an archive of fragmented pieces of information that interest me, and that I expect to use later.

# Creating your own Digital Garden

Create your own garden by cloning my own on [Github](https://github.com/rachelombok/digital-garden), or fork the [original one](https://github.com/lyz-code/blue-book) I created a template of lyz-code's.
