Planning \u2691 Intro: Decide what features you want to have, so that creating code later on will be easier and more efficient. Road Map: A roadmap outlines the entire game and what you will need at each step. Scenes: Think of these as the chapters to our visual novel. The scenes will hold the dialogue information for each encounter that you decide to create. Characters: You can\u2019t have a \u201cvisual\u201d novel without having characters. The characters will contain the information about their art and different possible poses. Dialog: What good is a character if it can\u2019t say anything? The dialog will be our script that the players will end up reading. Choices: Choices are what separates a game from other forms of media and lest the player interact with the game. The choices will go hand in hand with the dialog to allow the player to experience a dynamic story. Repo Link Visual Aspects \u2691 Background Art: If you just take real pictures and use a watercolor filter to save money on backgrounds, they are still important. It's a lot of work, but hand drawn sprites just look better on hand drawn backgrounds. Furthermore, with self-created backgrounds, you can create your own unique atmosphere. Character Sprites: Each major character of your visual novel will probably have around a dozen sprites. It's reccomended for beginner's to avoid using too many characters Computer Graphics: These are still images made to appear when certain scenes occur. These images are best used to convey events that cannot be shown accurately simply by moving the character sprites. Special Effects: Visual effects cannot be used by physical books but can be used by visual novels. A flash here or falling snow there, can easily enhance the amount of emotion of any given scene. Even something as simple as moving a sprite left or right or the way the text is shown on the screen is important! Background Music: The background music has to complement and enhance the text it is behind. Describing a soothing Slice of Life scene? Then use calming music! An action scene? Heavy Metal, of course! A Plot Twist goes great with Ominous Latin Chanting, and so on. Sound Effects: As with any audiovisual media, a well placed sound effect can have a great impact.","title":"visual novel"},{"location":"gamedevelopment/visualnovel/#creating-a-visual-novel-in-unity","text":"These are notes on how to create a visual novel in Unity, based on this tutorial .","title":"Creating a Visual Novel in Unity"},{"location":"gamedevelopment/visualnovel/#planning","text":"Intro: Decide what features you want to have, so that creating code later on will be easier and more efficient.
